                <p>I have been working on computers for over 30 years.  When I was in elementary school, I (well, my mother, but that is a different story) sold over 70 magazine subscriptions during a magazine drive.  One of the prizes that was available was a computer...the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A.  This computer came with 16 KBof RAM and used a cassette recorder to store data.</p>
                <p>One thing that I am <strong>REALLY</strong> passionate about is coffee.  About six years ago, a good friend of mine mentioned that I was doing coffee wrong.  The next day, he brought a jar with coffee beans in it.  When I asked the difference, he said that roasted them himself.  I tried the coffee and nothing has been the same ever since.</p>
                <p>First, it was buying beans from my friend.  Next, it was a roaster.  Then, another roaster, because I burned out a motor.  After another roaster, I upgraded to a better roaster.  Next, I started maintaining spreadsheets tracking datapoints.</p>
